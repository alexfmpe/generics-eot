`generics-eot` is a library for datatype generic programming that tries to be
very simple to understand and use. It's heavily inspired by the awesome
`generics-sop` package (http://hackage.haskell.org/package/generics-sop).

There's documentation in the source code (mainly in `Generics.Eot`), but there's
also some examples in `examples` (and tests in `test/Examples`).

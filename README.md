`generics-eot` is a library for datatype generic programming that tries to be
very simple to understand and use. It's heavily inspired by the awesome
`generics-sop` package (http://hackage.haskell.org/package/generics-sop).

There's documentation in the source code, there's a tutorial in
`Generics.Eot.Tutorial` and there's also some examples in `examples` (and
descriptive tests for them in `test/Examples`).
